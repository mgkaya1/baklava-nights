# Product Context - Baklava Nights

## Why This Project Exists
Baklava Nights was created to promote a premier Turkish Disco Pop DJ event in Sofia, Bulgaria, targeting music enthusiasts and nightlife seekers. The website serves as the central hub for event information, ticket sales, and brand building for this cultural entertainment experience.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Event Discovery**: Provides a single source of truth for event details (date, time, venue, pricing)
2. **Language Barriers**: Offers content in four languages (English, Turkish, Bulgarian, Arabic) to cater to diverse audiences
3. **Ticket Access**: Directs users to external ticketing platforms with clear call-to-action
4. **Information Gap**: Answers common event questions (capacity, amenities, corporate packages)
5. **Brand Consistency**: Establishes visual and messaging consistency across all touchpoints

## How It Should Work
