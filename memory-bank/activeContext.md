# Active Context - Baklava Nights

## Current Work Focus
Initializing and documenting the memory bank for the Baklava Nights event website. The website is currently live and functional, serving as the primary marketing platform for the October 10, 2025 event.

## Recent Changes
- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Created project documentation structure with projectbrief.md and productContext.md
- **Website Analysis**: Reviewed existing index.html to understand current implementation and features
- **Asset Inventory**: Identified key assets including logos, background images, and SVG files
- **Button Text Optimization**: Changed "GET YOUR TICKETS" to "GET TICKETS" in all languages for better brevity and conversion
- **Early Bird Text Update**: Changed "Buy early, pay less!" to "Tickets are available online only, due to high demand we do not promise on door sales" in all supported languages (EN, TR, BG, AR)
- **Post-Event Redesign**: Completely redesigned main page for event completion with "Stay Tuned for Our Next Event" message in all languages
- **Netlify Deployment**: Successfully deployed redesigned website to production at baklavanights.com

## Next Steps
1. Complete memory bank documentation with remaining files (systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md)
2. Verify all memory bank files are accurate and comprehensive
3. Review website functionality and identify any potential improvements
4. Ensure documentation covers all aspects of the current implementation

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Documentation Approach**: Using Markdown files for clear, maintainable documentation
- **Memory Bank Structure**: Following the hierarchical structure outlined in the custom instructions
- **Content Focus**: Emphasizing event details, multi-language support, and conversion optimization
- **Technical Debt**: Considering potential refactoring opportunities for better maintainability

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Multi-language Implementation**: Using client-side JavaScript for language switching with localStorage persistence
- **SEO Best Practices**: Comprehensive meta tags, Open Graph, and structured data implementation
- **Analytics Integration**: Facebook Pixel and Google Analytics with GDPR-compliant consent management
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with specific breakpoints for various devices
- **Performance Optimization**: Preloading critical resources and using SVG assets for scalability

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Event Website Requirements**: Need for clear CTAs, social proof, and essential event information
- **International Audience**: Importance of multi-language support for diverse user base
- **Privacy Compliance**: GDPR requirements necessitating cookie consent implementation
- **External Integrations**: Reliance on external ticketing platform rather than built-in solution
- **Asset Management**: Use of SVG logos for crisp rendering across all devices

The website is fully functional with:
