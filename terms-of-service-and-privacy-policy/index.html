      unless stated otherwise.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Fraud and Resale:</span> We reserve the right to limit ticket purchases or cancel orders

      days to the original payment method.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Postponement or Significant Changes:</span> In accordance with Bulgarian consumer
      protection law, if the event is postponed or undergoes significant changes (e.g., venue or date change), ticket
      holders will be offered the option to attend the rescheduled event or receive a full refund. Refunds must be
      requested within 14 days of notification via <a
        href="mailto:info@baklavaventures.com">info@baklavaventures.com</a>.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">No Buyer-Initiated Refunds:</span> Under Bulgarian consumer law, tickets are
      non-refunded for buyer-initiated cancellations (e.g., change of plans, inability to attend). We reserve the right
      to not issue refunds unless the event date or location is changed by the organizer.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Discretionary Refunds:</span> Refund requests for exceptional circumstances (e.g.,
      medical emergencies) may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Contact us within 7 days of the event with
      supporting documentation.</li>
